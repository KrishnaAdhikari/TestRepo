This Readme file is just a part of my first git/github test. It was created with 'touch' command on 1/31/16. Touch created 
an empty file but I opened and added these lines from Notepod.
lsla

Second edit.
First successful push only showed a blank file (no text that was there in the beginning). So, I am trying it again. (1/31/16).

lslas;dl;;;
Trying again after it said:

$ git commit
